This zip contains all Java related jars of the Dolphin Platform.
Clients for other languages can be found separately (JavaScript, AngularJS, Polymer).

It's best practice to use a build tool like Maven or Gradle when creating an application based
on Dolphin Platform since the Dolphin Platform Jars needs external dependencies that are not part of
this release.

A complete release that contains all the needed external libraries might be supported in future versions.
