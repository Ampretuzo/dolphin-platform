Hi - please make sure to check this notes whenever you create an issue for Dolphin Platform:

- If you are not using the last version of Dolphin Platform please add the used version in the description
- Please give us some information about the server infrastructure that you are using. Examples: Spring Boot 1.2.2 or JBOSS 6.4 EAP
- In case of an error / bug it's always helpful to add the error logging from the client and server application
