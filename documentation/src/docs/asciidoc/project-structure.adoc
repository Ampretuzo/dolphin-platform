= Creating a Dolphin Platform application from sratch

Maybe some developers don't want to use the Maven archetype to create a new Dolphin Platform based application or want to
integrate the Dolphin Platform in an existing application. Even if the Maven archetype is the fasted way to set up a
startable project it's quite easy to create such an application from scratch.

== Definition of the needed server and client modules

The API and implementation of the Dolphin Platform is splitted in several modules. Depending on the application
infrastructure a developer needs to add different modules to the application dependencies. The following diagramm
gives an overview of all Dolphin Platform modules:

=== Dolphin Platform on the server

On the server side you can choose between a JavaEE or a Spring integration. Each of this
modules depends on the basic server module of the Dolphin Platform that contains the public
API for the server part. Based on this you only need to add one dependency to your server
application. All modules on the server are full compatible to Java 7 and above.

You can simply integrate Dolphin Platform in a Spring based application. To do so you only need to add the Spring
module. All Java modules of the Dolphin Platform are available at Maven Central and JCenter. The following snippet
shows the spring module as a Maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.canoo.dolphin-platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>dolphin-platform-server-spring</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.9</version>
</dependency>
----

Next to this the Dolphin Platform provides support for JavaEE. The following snippet shows the JavaEE module of the
Dolphin Platform as a Maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.canoo.dolphin-platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>dolphin-platform-server-javaee</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.9</version>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: Additional information can be found in the JavaEE and Spring chapter of this documentation.

=== Dolphin Platform on the client

Since all Dolphin Platform modules on the server a written in Java the client modules are written in multiple programming
languages to support as many platforms as possible. Currently you can choose between a Java implementation for Desktop
and mobile clients (JavaFX and Android) and a JavaScript implementation with special API for several JavaScript frameworks
(currently Polymer and AngularJS).
