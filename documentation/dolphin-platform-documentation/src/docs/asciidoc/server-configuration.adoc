= Server configuration

The Dolphin Platform can simply be configured by a property file. To configure the server part of the Dolphin Platform a `dolphin.properties`-file must be created in the `META-INF` folder. In a Maven based project the file would be defined as `project/src/main/resources/META-INF/dolphin.properties`. This file must be defined as a regular Java property file. Here is an example how such a file might look:
[source,txt]
----
openDolphinLogLevel=OFF
useCrossSiteOriginFilter=true
----

== Supported properties

Currently the following properties are supported by the Dolphin Platform:

.Table title
|===
|Name |Description |Supported values |Default value

|openDolphinLogLevel
|Defines the logging level for the remoting layer.
|off, severe, warning, info, config, fine, finer, finest, all
|severe

|useCrossSiteOriginFilter
|Boolean property that defines if the HTTP filter for the cross site origin policy should be used. By default the filter will be used.
|true, false
|true

|useSessionInvalidationServlet
|Boolean property that defines if the servlet for session validation should be used. By default the servlet will not be used. We plan to remove the servlet completelly in a future release and this property is just for a fallback if not using the servelt will end in issues.
|true, false
|false


|servletMapping
|A string based property that defines the server URL endpoint for the Dolphin Platform.
|any String that defines an URL mapping
|/dolphin

|garbageCollectionActive
|By activating the garbage collection the Dolphin Platform checks internally if Dolphin beans are referenced (for example in a Dolphin Bean hierarchy). If not this beans will automatically be removed on the server and the client. This is an unstable feature at the moment and should only be activated for tests.
|true, false
|false
