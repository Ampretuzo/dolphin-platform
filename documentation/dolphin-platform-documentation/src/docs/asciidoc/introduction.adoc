= Introduction

The Dolphin Platform is a framework that implements the remote presentation model pattern and provides a modern way to create enterprise applications. As you might know there are several of these frameworks out there. So let us start by describing what makes the Dolphin Platform special and why we decided to create it.


== Architecture overview

In the Dolphin Platform, all models will automatically be synchronized between client and server. Thus, you don't need to think about any specific endpoints or requests.

Based on this, the Dolphin Platform defines server side controllers that contain all the controller logic for a specific view. The lifecycle of these controllers is automatically synchronized with the view lifecycle. With this approach you have a MVC group for each client view with a synchronized model and a managed controller.

The Dolphin Platform provides a server and client framework that let you easily write applications based on the described pattern. To do so the platform contains support for well known sever framework like JavaEE or Spring and several implementations to create clients by using for example JavaFX or Polymer.
