<h1>The Model API</h1>

<p>One of the core features and maybe the most important concept of Dolphin Platform is the model synchronization between client and server. For each view in the client a controller instance “lives” in the server that defines all the logic of the view. A model is automatially shared and synchronized between the client view and the controller on the server.</p>

<p>Such a model can be a bean or a hierarchy of several beans. Dolphin Platform provides an API to create full observable beans for the model layer.</p>

<h3>Create a bean</h3>

<p>A model for the Dolphin Platform can simply be defined as a Java bean but instead of using primitive date types for all the attributes of the bean Dolphin Platform provides the <code>Property&lt;V&gt;</code> interface that should be used to define attributes. Based on this a definition for a bean with only one String attribute will look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="java">@DolphinBean
public class MyModel {

    private Property&lt;String&gt; value;
    
    public Property&lt;String&gt; valueProperty() {
        return value;
    }
    
    public String getValue() {
        return value.get();
    }
   
    public void setValue(String value) {
           this.value.set(value);
    }

}
</code></pre>
